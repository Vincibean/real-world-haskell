Is the order in which we call `bracket` and `handle` important? Why?

---

Let's have a look at `bracket`'s signature:

```haskell
bracket :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> (a -> IO c) -> IO c
```

It takes three arguments: the first ("acquire") acquires the resource; the second ("release") releases the resource; the third ("use") runs in between, while the resource is acquired.

If an exception occurs while the "use" action is executing, `bracket` calls the "release" action and rethrows the exception.

Hence, if we want to write a completely safe function, we need to use both `bracket` and `handle`.

Moreover, it's important to use them in a given order (`handle` and then `bracket`): this guarantees that all the exceptions are caught at the topmost level, and that nothing can creep out, even from other actions (e.g. the "acquire" action).

What is the type of `(,)`? When you use it in ghci, what does it do? What about `(,,)`?

---

The type of `(,)` is:
```haskell
(,) :: a -> b -> (a, b)
```
When  used in `ghci`, it allows for the creation of a new tuple. In particular:
```haskell
(1, 2) == (,) 1 2
```
i.e. `(1, 2)` is just syntactic sugar for `(,) 1 2`.

The type of `(,,)` is:
```haskell
(,,) :: a -> b -> c -> (a, b, c)
```
Similarly as before, `(1, 2, 3)` is just syntactic sugar for `(,,) 1 2 3`

Use ghci to explore what happens if you pass a malformed pattern, such as `[`, to `globToRegex`. 
Write a small function that calls globToRegex, and pass it a malformed pattern. What happens?

---

We end up having the following error message:

```
"^*** Exception: unterminated character class
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at GlobRegex.hs:17:24 in main:GlobRegex
```

This happens at line 17, i.e. during the execution of `globToRegex'`, but we can also trigger it at line 28, during the execution of `charClass` simply by invoking something such as `globToRegex "[]"` or `globToRegex "[]"`.
